        "Biofeedback resolution reduces progressively: numeric → range → texture → silence",

    "description": "A system-level safeguard enforcing that coherence cannot be forced or observed as a metric. Encourages natural surrender and embodied presence; prevents performative or narcissistic exploitation of fractals."
